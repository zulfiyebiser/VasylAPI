	CRUD
					In SQL
	C - create | INSERT
	R - read   | SELECT
	U - update | UPDATE
	D - delete | DELETE

	In API, there are HTTP verbs fro CRUD operations:

	POST (CREATE) - to create something, and then you should get 201 status code, if no - it's a bug, or you failed to create something because your request was not correct.

	POST: baseUrl/spartans
	we don't specify id, because it's auto generated value.

	{

	  "name": "Galatasaray",
	  "gender": "Male",
	  "phone": 12023615117
	}

	Whenever you are getting status code 4XX - that means problem on your side. Either URL is wrong, or you don't have a permission, or your request was formed in the wrong way.


	GET (READ) - to read the data from web service. You should get 200 status code (means OK) if your request went well.


	PUT (UPDATE) - to update existing record. You can get 200 (OK) or 204 (no content),  if your request went well. In case of PUT, you have completely replace existing record:

Let's say we have this user...

	{
	  "id": 150
	  "name": "Galatasaray",
	  "gender": "Male",
	  "phone": 12023615117
	}

To update him, we need to perform PUT request.
Body of your PUT request, should contain all attributes, except id:

	PUT: baseUrl/spartans/:id    | id - is a path parameter

	PUT: baseUrl/spartans/150

	Body:

	{
	  "name": "New Name",
	  "gender": "Male",
	  "phone": 12023615117
	}

We specify id as path parameter.
Because web service, must know which record to update.
If you gonna miss at least one parameter, It will not work.

	DELETE (DELETE) - to delete some record.


	DELETE: baseUrl/spartans/:id | id - is a path parameter

	DELETE baseUrl/spartans/150

	As a response, you should get either 200 (OK), or 204 (NO CONTENT). Otherwise, either your request is not correct (4XX status code) or something wrong with a system.


204 (NO CONTENT) - means no JSON/XML/etc. body in the response.

If you added something over API into web service --> data will be stored in the data base, UI.

If you deleted something via API from web service --> data will be gone from data base, UI.


PATCH (UPDATE) - partial update of existing record. In case of PUT, we have to completely replace existing record. But, in case of PATCH, you can update one or more properties of existing record. In case of success, you should get 200 (OK) or 204 (NO CONTENT). If you are getting 4XX status - problem in your request, 5XX - problem in the server, could be the bug.


Let's say we have this user...

	{
	  "id": 150
	  "name": "Galatasaray",
	  "gender": "Male",
	  "phone": 12023615117
	}

To update him, we need to perform PATCH request.
Body of your PATCH request, can contain 1 or mote attributes, except id:

	PATCH: baseUrl/spartans/:id    | id - is a path parameter

	PATCH: baseUrl/spartans/150

	Body:

	{
	  "name": "New Name",
	}

	OR

	{
	  "phone": 45464654654
	}

	OR like this....

	{
	  "name": "Jasmine",
	  "gender": "Female",
	}

As you can see, GET and DELETE requests performs without body, but POST, PUT, PATCH - with body.

Also, in case of DELETE, you might get 405 status code (NOT ALLOWED) that means you cannot delete something. Also, whenever you PUT, POST, PATCH, don't forget to specify content type. If you are sending JSON file, provide content type as JSON. Otherwise, system might confuse your JSON with plain text, because they look alike.


Payload = body.

Keep in mind that not every web service supports certain operations. For example: PATCH. So to understand what your web service can do, what it requires to perform request (end point, API key, authentication, cookies, proxy, etc) you should read API doc (like Swagger).

All web applications have API. Because, there is no way to deliver data from business logic component to UI. Also, Modern application are not monolith. Now days, applications are build of micro services. Micro service it's a small web service, that performs certain operations for web application, but not all. It would would be to difficult to update, manage, deploy web application that would be single unit. Instead, developers use micro services. An communication among micro services happens via API.




New ORDS url: http://ec2-3-81-4-150.compute-1.amazonaws.com:1000/ords/hr


Create ORDS_QA environment in Postman

variable name  |  value
baseUrl		   | http://ec2-3-81-4-150.compute-1.amazonaws.com:1000/ords/hr

You can use yours too...

just replace host name: ec2-3-81-4-150.compute-1.amazonaws.com
